        <p>US President Donald Trump has said that the United States needs to take ownership of Greenland to ensure that Russia and China do not gain control of the territory. According to a report by US media outlet CNN on Friday (January 9), Trump made these remarks stressing the importance of ownership rather than leasing.

Trump stated that a territory cannot be protected simply through leasing; ownership is necessary. He warned that the United States would choose either an easy or a hard path if required.

The White House has said that the option of purchasing the semi-autonomous territory—currently under NATO member Denmark—is under consideration. The possibility of using force has also not been ruled out.

However, Denmark and Greenland have clearly stated that Greenland is not for sale. Denmark has warned that any military action would undermine the very foundation of the NATO alliance.

The United States considers Greenland extremely important due to its strategic position in the Arctic region. Trump said the territory could be used for early missile warning systems and for monitoring naval movement in the Arctic.

The US president has repeatedly claimed that Greenland is vital to US national security. Without providing any evidence, he has alleged that Russian and Chinese ships are operating in and around the region.

Currently,
x more than a hundred US troops are stationed in Greenland, and a US military base has been operational there since World War II.

Trump said, “I love the people of China. I love the people of Russia. But I do not want them to be our neighbors in Greenland. That will not happen. NATO needs to understand this.”

Following Trump’s comments, major European countries and Canada have expressed support for Denmark, stating that the right to decide Greenland’s future belongs solely to Greenland and Denmark.

In a joint statement, Greenland’s political parties said they do not want to remain under either American or Danish control, but wish to exist as Greenlanders. They emphasized that the people of Greenland alone will decide the future of the territory.</p>

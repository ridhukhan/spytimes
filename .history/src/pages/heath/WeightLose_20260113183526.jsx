      <h2>1. Follow a Balanced Diet</h2>
      <p>The first step to healthy weight loss is following a balanced diet. Include adequate amounts of protein, vegetables, fruits, and whole grains in your daily meals. Protein plays a crucial role in weight loss as it reduces hunger and keeps you feeling full for a longer time. Good sources of protein include chicken, eggs, fish, lentils, and chickpeas.</p>

      <h2>3. Drink Enough Water</h2>
      <p>Drinking sufficient water is very important for weight loss. Water helps flush out toxins from the body and increases metabolism. Try to drink 8–10 glasses of water daily. Drinking water 30 minutes before meals can reduce hunger and prevent overeating.</p>

      <h2>4. Get Adequate Sleep</h2>
      <p>Adequate sleep is crucial for a healthy body. Ensure 7–8 hours of quality sleep every night. Lack of sleep slows down metabolism and increases hunger hormones, leading to increased food intake.</p>

      <h2>13. Stay Active Throughout the Day</h2>
